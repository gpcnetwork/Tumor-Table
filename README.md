# Tumor-Table
The PCORnet tumor table contains data from hospital tumor registries that are formatted according to standards developed by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). All hospitals that are accredited by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer employ trained registrars to abstract medical record data according to these specifications. Structured fields for demographic, clinical, and treatment observations are included, and the data are considered to be high quality. The tumor table documentation includes specifications for data formats, quality checks, and relationships with other CDM tables. This standardization allows linkages between NAACCR data and the other CDM tables. It also allows queries of the NAACCR data to be quickly deployed across the network.

This repo contains the PCORnet tumor table specification documentation and script to allow for the production of a tumor table data quality report. Further resources may be added as they are developed.
